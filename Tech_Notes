Technical notes for Mr.Amr & more:
    
    - You wanted to know how long does it take to finalize tasks, I would say it takes a day approximately,
        or a bit less but it took me 1 day and half to achieve the 1st task, as I went to the wrong approach 
        to implement a custom backend authentication in parralel with the default username field
        and that took me to a loop hole.
        I believe that was wrong although I found the solution was only making the phone field 
        the default one and that was so easy, sometimes easy things would be away from your mind
        it happens rarely.
    
    - First 2 tasks are done, 3rd one is not as I took long and decided to send what I've done.
    
    - There are other approaches I would go with in real world apps, like splitting the API code
        from the accounts app, renaming endpoints withh other names and write better README,
        but this is for the purpose of the assessment. 
    
    - autopep8 is used for formating but there are lines aligned in purpose to be clearer (prefered by myself).
    
    - There are other customization I would go with, but for these tasks that works.
    - 
    - formatting response of task one in case of failure is not exactly the same, but very similar,
        I would change it field by field but find {DRY princible} would be disturbed.
    
    - Extending {AbstractBaseUser} might seem alot, and would be easier to use {AbstractUser},
        but it's just preferable for me to override default fields and begin from down up.

    - I did not make tests coz of time, and I believe I need to work on my testing skills too.

AT LAST: that might be alot to write, but I believe this would help you understand my experience & 
my mindset and lead to take the right decision in general for both of us.

Please feel free to ask if you have any question
Thanks Mr.Amr for your consideration & and would love to read your feed-back on my code if possible whenever you have time that helps me to improve alot.
